## 👋 Hi, I'm Nirvana!

"I'm a Cybersecurity specialist | AI specialist | junior Machine Learning engineering | Data scientist | Entrepreneur

 with a strong background in Cybersecurity Operations and Threat Intelligence. My passion lies in applying Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Generative AI to solve real-world problems. I have experience with MLOps tools like MLflow, Docker, and Kubernetes for deploying scalable solutions (like my Real-Time Object Detection API). With 6+ years in security, I also leverage my expertise to enhance threat detection and vulnerability scanning using AI/ML, and apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework in my work (e.g., ATT-CKGenius project).
